"# Restro_Project_Management_System" 

Project Overview

Our group created the Restro Project Management System, a web-based restaurant platform that allows customers to browse dishes, place their food orders, and interact with the restaurant digitally. The project also includes a dedicated admin panel, where restaurant staff can manage menu items, view customer orders, and update order statuses.


Our system us build with :

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python Flask
Database: MongoDB (MongoEngine ORM)
Authentication: Flask session-based login
Architecture: RESTful API


Application Idea

The Restro Project Management System is designed to modernize the way customers interact with a restaurant. The main idea of the application is to create an easy-to-use online platform where customers can:

Explore dishes and special items directly from the homepage.
View detailed menu information including price, images, and ratings.
Create an account and place their food orders quickly through an online form.
Submit reviews and share their feedback about dishes and service.

Alongside customer features, the system also supports restaurant administrators by providing a dedicated admin dashboard where they can:
Manage menu items by adding, editing, or removing dishes.
Review and process customer orders as they come in.
Update the order status (pending, preparing, completed).
Monitor customer reviews and manage feedback.

The goal of this system is to replace traditional manual order-taking with a smooth digital workflow. By combining a clean frontend interface with a structured backend system, the project ensures a responsive, reliable, and user-friendly experience for both customers and restaurant staff.


Audience

The system is designed for a variety of users. Its main users are customers who visit the website to explore the available dishes, view details, and place their food orders online. The platform also serves restaurant staff, who access the admin panel to manage menu items and handle incoming customer orders efficiently. In addition, the website supports general visitors, including new or occasional customers, who simply want to browse the restaurant’s offerings and learn more about what is available.

 
Purpose of the Project

To give users online access to view dishes and place orders anytime.
